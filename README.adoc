== Introduction

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to change the logging level of a running application using the Spring Boot Actuator.

== Running the application

To run the application, execute the following command:

[source,shellscript]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun -args='--server.port=18080'
----

This will start the application on port 18080 to avoid conflicts with the default port of 8080.

Navigate to the following URL to see logger levels for the application:
